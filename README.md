# Bombay Groove Website

Bombay Groove is my own band. We have been together for 10 years, and perform Bollywood and Western music as a String 
Quartet (Two Violins, a Viola and a 'Cello). We mainly perform at Asian Weddings, but also at parties and corporate events.

Our current website, just like our band, is 10 years old too. It's starting to look dated, and lacks some of the functionality of a 
modern site. For example, it lacks responsive design. I would like to use this project to design and build my own custom 
Bombay Groove site. One that better represents our services and brand, and is much more up-to-date in terms of UI and UX.

## UX

### User Stories

* User Story 1: I am a potential client, and want to find out about who you are, what you do, and what you charge 
  so that I can decide whether to book you for my event.
* User Story 2: I am a potential client, and I would like to see a video of you performing, so that I can 
  determine whether you are the right kind of entertainment for my event. 
* User Story 3: I am a potential client and I want to see whether you play my favourite song
  so that I can book you for my event.
* User Story 4: I am a musician, and am interested in getting in touch with you so that I can 
  potentially work/collaborate with you in the future.
* User Story 5: I am an event planner/entertainment agency, and I want to see photos of you, and 
  videos of you perform, so that I can potentially collaborate with you in the future. 
* User Story 6: I am a visitor to your site, and I want to be able to find my way around your site easily,
  so that I can find the information that I need quickly. 

  I created some wireframes in response to the above User Stories. After creating the 1st site map, 
  I realised that the scope of the project was too big, and didn't really respond to the user Stories 
  in a conscise manner with good UX. So I then created 'Site Map 2', which is much better from a UX 
  point of view. My wireframes are [here]:

  ## Site Owner's Goal.

 * I am the business owner, and want to have all of my promotional material in one place,
  so that it's easy for potential clients to access, and make a booking. I also want to make sure that our name is 
  clearly displayed, as well as our email address, and that there are links to our social media sites, so that 
  users can be directed to them in order to increase our following.

## Features.

  After reviewing my user stories and site owner's goal, I decided to implement the following features throughout the site.

### Sitewide features.

* Feature 1: A clear, concise navbar at the top of the page. This allows the user to easily navigate the site and find the 
  information that they need.
* Feature 2: A clickable email address in the top right-hand corner of the page, which links to the user's default 
  email client.
* Feature 3: A footer bar with links to our social media sites, so that users can easily visit us there too.
 
### Pages.  

#### Page 1: Landing Page:
    
    * Feature 1: A strong, visually appealing hero image, in the form of a photo of the band playing on a stage at a wedding.
    This immediately allows user 1 to see what we do.
    * Feature 2: A header with our name on it. This allows user 1 to immediately find out our name.Also, as sometimes visitors 
    find us through generic internet searches, rather than by name, for the site owner, this will allow us to build brand awareness.
    * Feature 3: A separate section with information on 'Who we are', 'What We Do', and our prices. This allows user 1 
    user to find out
