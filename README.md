# Bombay Groove Website

Bombay Groove is my own band. We have been together for 10 years, and perform Bollywood and Western music as a String 
Quartet (Two Violins, a Viola and a 'Cello). We mainly perform at Asian Weddings, but also at parties and corporate events.

Our current website, just like our band, is 10 years old too. It's starting to look dated, and lacks some of the functionality of a 
modern site. For example, it lacks responsive design. I would like to use this project to design and build my own custom 
Bombay Groove site. One that better represents our services and brand, and is much more up-to-date in terms of UI and UX.

## UX
---

### User Stories

* User Story 1: I am a potential client, and want to find out about who you are, what you do, and what you charge 
  so that I can decide whether to book you for my event.
* User Story 2: I am a potential client, and I want to see some quotes from previous clients, so that I can be 
  reassured about the quality of your service.
* User Story 3: I am a potential client, and I would like to see a video and hear some audio of you performing, 
  so that I can determine whether you are the right kind of entertainment for my event. 
* User Story 4: I am a potential client and I want to see whether you play my favourite song
  so that I can book you for my event.
* User Story 5: I am a musician, and am interested in getting in touch with you so that I can 
  potentially work/collaborate with you in the future.
* User Story 6: I am an event planner/entertainment agency, and I want to see photos of you, and 
  videos of you perform, so that I can potentially collaborate with you in the future. 
* User Story 7: I am a visitor to your site, and I want to be able to find my way around your site easily,
  so that I can find the information that I need quickly. 

### Site Owner's Goal.


  I am the business owner, and want to have all of my promotional material in one place,
  so that it's easy for potential clients to access, and make a booking. I also want to make sure that our name is 
  clearly displayed, as well as our email address, and that there are links to our social media sites, so that 
  users can be directed to them in order to increase our following.

## Wireframes.
---
  I created some wireframes in response to the above User Stories. After creating the 1st site map, 
  I realised that the scope of the project was too big, and didn't really respond to the user Stories 
  in a conscise manner with good UX. So I then created 'Site Map 2', which is much better from a UX 
  point of view. My wireframes are here.

## Features.
---
  After reviewing my user stories, site owner's goal and wireframes, I decided to implement the following features throughout the site.

### Sitewide features.

* Feature 1: A clear, concise navbar at the top of the page. This allows the user to easily navigate the site and find the 
  information that they need. It is fixed to the top, in order to reduce the need for scrolling when navigating the site.
* Feature 2: A clickable email address in the top right-hand corner of the page, which links to the user's default 
  email client.
* Feature 3: A footer bar with links to our social media sites, so that users can easily visit us there too.
 
### Pages.  

I designed the individual pages based on my user stories, with good UX in mind.

#### Page 1: Landing Page.
    
* Feature 1: A strong, visually appealing hero image, in the form of a photo of the band playing on a stage at a wedding.
  This immediately allows user 1 to see what we do.
* Feature 2: A header with our name on it. This allows user 1 to immediately find out who we are. Also, as sometimes visitors 
  find us through generic internet searches, rather than by name, for the site owner, this will allow us to build brand awareness.
* Feature 3: A separate section with information on 'Who we are', 'What We Do', and our prices. This allows user 1 to quickly 
  find the imformation they need.
* Feature 4: A separate 'Quotes' section, defined visually by the use of a contrasting colour, for good UX. This will 
  allow user 2 to quickly find the information they need.

#### Page 2: Watch/Listen Page:

* Feature 1: An embedded YouTube video of Bombay Groove's Showreel. This allows users 3 and 6 to easily access the material they need.
* Feature 2: Embedded Sound Cloud audio tracks. This also allows user 3 to easily access the material he needs. 
* Feature 3: I have changed the background colour of the 'Listen' section to match that of the 'Quotes' section on the Landing Page, in order to provide
  continuity between the pages, and to create a clear separation between the 'Watch' and 'Listen' sections in order to maintain good UX.

#### Page 3: Repertoire.

* Feature 1: Clickable headers, which each open PDF repertoire lists in a new window. One for each style of music we perform.
  This allows user 4 to easily find out whether thier favourite song is on the list, without navigating away from the page.  

#### Page 4: Gallery.

* Feature 1: Photos of the band performing at events, and also some group shots at venues. This allows user 6 to see 
  what we look like, and visualise us performing at their events.

#### Page 5: Contact.

* Feature 1: Clearly displayed contact details (email address and phone number) with clickable phone and envelope icons.
  This allows all users to be able to contact us easily in order to make a booking or collaborate. 

### Features Left to Implement.

* Usually if I were to update my website, I would make sure that I had plenty of new photos, videos and
audio tracks to add. However, as we are currently unable to meet due to the lockdown in the UK, this 
has not been possible. I would like to add this material as soon as is possible.
I would also like to add a searchable database of songs, so that potential clients can choose what they 
would like us to play more easily. 

### Features Chosen Not to Implement.

* I chose not to add a contact form on my site. This was because I believe that it would be negative UX
to have one in the case of this business. Filling in a form with several fields would take longer than 
clicking an icon and writing the same information in an email.

### Aditional Comments.

* Lots of bands rely mainly on images and audio on their websites, rather than text, as their sites are 
designed for their fans who already have a pretty good idea of what they do. Bombay Groove is a 
function band. My site is there to sell a service to people who may have never heard of the band, 
who may not know what a string quartet is, and may not have imagined that Bollywood music could be 
performed on what are traditionally western instruments. They are interested in booking us for a 
one-off event, and like to be able to find out all of the information they need before they contact us.
Therefore, I feel that it's crucial to have all of the text that we have on the site in order to successfully 
convey our servive, and secure bookings. 


## Technologies Used.
---
* HTML5 was used to provide the structure of the site.
* CSS3 was used to style the site.
* The Bootstrap 4.5 framework was used to create a responsive site structure for mobile, tablet and desktop devices. https://getbootstrap.com/
* JS, Popper.js and JQuery were used through Bootstrap in order to provide additional style to the site.
* Google Fonts was used to provide appropriate typography throught the site. https://fonts.google.com/
* Font Awesome was used to provide social media icons. https://fontawesome.com/start
* Gitpod was used throughout as a development environment. https://gitpod.io/ and files were pushed to, and stored on
  Github for version control. https://github.com
* Balsamiq was used to create wireframes for the project. https://balsamiq.com/
* YouTube was used to embed a video. https://www.youtube.com/
* SoundCloud was used to embed audio players. https://soundcloud.com/
* Favicon.io was used to generate a favicon. https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/

## Design.
---
### Imagery. 

* I deliberately chose striking, colourful images of the band that immediately gives the user an idea of what they 
    can expect if they book us for an event. On the landing page, I deliberately chose one of us performing at a
    wedding.
* The gallery page shows a mixture of us performing and not performing, in a mixture of outfits - in order to show 
    various costume oprions that we offer.

### Colour Scheme.

* I chose white as the colour for the text on the jumbotron, as I felt that this made an excellent contrast with the 
image. I tried some other colours, but felt that white was the most striking, and looked the best.
* As I had chosen white for the jumbotron, I chose to have a dark navbar and footer, so that I could use white for 
the links - in order to match the jumbotron text colour.
* I chose white as the main background colour, in order to match the colour of the text on the navbar, and of the jumbotron.
* I chose to change the background colour of some of the sections, in order to make a clear distinction between them.
For this I used the colour picker tool on 'dev tools' in order to find the one that matched the colours in the landing 
page hero image the best. I chose a pink colour: #ff4f4f, with an opacity of 0.75.
* I chose white lettering on a pink background for the favicon as this tied in with the general colour
scheme of my site.

### Typography.

* Throughout the site I chose the 'Bebas Neue' font, with a fallback of cursive for the headers, 
and 'Roboto', with a fallback of sans-serif for the content. 

## Testing.
---
* All site pages, and the css stylesheet were inputted into the w3 code validators. They all passed with no errors.
* All pages were tested in Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Microsoft Edge and IOS. They all worked well in all of these browsers.

I undertook the following additional tests on my site.

### Sitewide Features.

1. Navbar.
    * Click on each link on the navbar, and make sure they all direct the user to the correct page.
    * Click on the email address in the top right hand corner, and check it directs the user to their email client.
    * Repeat the above steps for all pages.

2. Footer and Social Media Links.
    * Check that the Footer and Social Media icons are well placed on all pages, and on all devices. 
    * Check that all Social Media icons link to the relevant sites.

#### Landing Page.

1. Hero Image and Jumbotron.
    * Check that the image is responsive, and looks good on all devices. 

2.  * 'Who we Are', 'What We Do', 'Prices' and 'Quotes'. Check for typos, and check that the text layout is visually appealing 
       on all devices.

#### Watch/Listen Page.

1. Embedded Media.
    * Click on the embedded YouTube video and SoundCloud audio tracks to make sure they work.

#### Repertoire Page.

1. Playlists.
    * Click on the playlist headers and check that they open a PDF in a new window.

#### Gallery Page.

1. Images.
    * Check that all images look as expected on all devices.

#### Contact Page.

1. Contact Information.
    * Check that the envelope icon links to the email client, and that the phone icon is able to dial the number.

### Bugs 
---
* I found that my responsive design didn't work quite as well as it should have initially. I therefore spent a lot of 
time trying it out on different screen sizes, and creating appropriate media queries to fix this.

#### Responsive Design.

* I designed my website to be responsive. For tablet-sized screens in portrait mode, I changed the layout of the landing page from having 
a jumbotron overlaying the hero image to having the title of the band and the subtitle underneath, as I felt that 
this suited the screen size better. I also changed from a three column layout to a two column layout. 

* On mobile sized screens I used the same hero image layout as on the tablet, but had all text elements in one column 
instead. On the smallest screens I reduced the size of some of the text on the Contact page so that it fitted.

* For the gallery page, I also removed the jumbotron for tablet and mobile screen sizes for aesthetic reasons.

### Deployment.
---
I deployed my site to GitHub pages. The code can be run locally through GitPod.

#### Acknowledgements.

* My inspiration for this project was drawn from my current situation. In a few short months I have 
gone from being an extremely busy professional musician, to being locked down and banned from working 
as a musician, to becoming a student again. Luckily I have found out that I am also extremely passionate 
about coding, so hopefully I have some more promising job opportunities ahead of me. My colleagues in 
Bombay Groove are not as fortunate, so I decided to design a new website, so they're ready to 'hit the 
ground running' again when the restrictions on performing are lifted.
