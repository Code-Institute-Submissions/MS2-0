# Bombay Groove Website

Bombay Groove is my own band. We have been together for 10 years, and perform Bollywood and Western music as a String 
Quartet (Two Violins, a Viola and a 'Cello). We mainly perform at Asian Weddings, but also at parties and corporate events.

Our current website, just like our band, is 10 years old too. It's starting to look dated, and lacks some of the functionality of a 
modern site. For example, it lacks responsive design. I would like to use this project to design and build my own custon 
Bombay Groove site. One that better represents our services and brand, and is much more up-to-date in terms of UI and UX.
