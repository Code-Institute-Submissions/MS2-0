# Bombay Groove Website

Bombay Groove is my own band. We have been together for 10 years, and perform Bollywood and Western music as a String 
Quartet (Two Violins, a Viola and a 'Cello). We mainly perform at Asian Weddings, but also at parties and corporate events.

Our current website, just like our band, is 10 years old too. It's starting to look dated, and lacks some of the functionality of a 
modern site. For example, it lacks responsive design. I would like to use this project to design and build my own custom 
Bombay Groove site. One that better represents our services and brand, and is much more up-to-date in terms of UI and UX.

## UX

### User Stories

* User Story 1: I am a potential client, and want to find out about what you do, and what you charge 
  so that I can decide whether to book you for my event.
* User Story 2: I am a potential client, and I would like to see a video of you performing, so that I can 
  determine whether you are the right kind of entertainment for my event. 
* User Story 3: I am a potential client and I want to see whether you play my favourite song
  so that I can book you for my event.
* User Story 4: I am a musician, and am interested in getting in touch with you so that I can 
  potentially work/collaborate with you in the future.
* User Story 5: I am an event planner/entertainment agency, and I want to see photos of you, and 
  videos of you perform, so that I can potentially collaborate with you in the future. 

  I created some wireframes in response to the above User Stories. After creating the 1st site map, 
  I realised that the scope of the project was too big, and didn't really respond to the user Stories 
  in a conscise manner with good UX. So I then created 'Site Map 2', which is much better from a UX 
  point of view. My wireframes are here:

  ## Site Owner's Goal.

 * I am the business owner, and want to have all of my promotional material in one place,
  so that it's easy for potential clients to access, and make a booking.
