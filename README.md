# Bombay Groove Website

Bombay Groove is my own band. We have been together for 10 years, and perform Bollywood and Western music as a String 
Quartet (Two Violins, a Viola and a 'Cello). We mainly perform at Asian Weddings, but also at parties and corporate events.

Our current website, just like our band, is 10 years old too. It's starting to look dated, and lacks some of the functionality of a 
modern site. For example, it lacks responsive design. I would like to use this project to design and build my own custom 
Bombay Groove site. One that better represents our services and brand, and is much more up-to-date in terms of UI and UX.

## UX

### User Stories

* User Story 1: I am a potential client, and want to find out about who you are, what you do, and what you charge 
  so that I can decide whether to book you for my event.
  User Story 2: I am a potential client, and I want to see some quotes from previous clients, so that I can be 
  reassured about the quality of your service.
* User Story 3: I am a potential client, and I would like to see a video and hear some audio of you performing, 
  so that I can determine whether you are the right kind of entertainment for my event. 
* User Story 4: I am a potential client and I want to see whether you play my favourite song
  so that I can book you for my event.
* User Story 5: I am a musician, and am interested in getting in touch with you so that I can 
  potentially work/collaborate with you in the future.
* User Story 6: I am an event planner/entertainment agency, and I want to see photos of you, and 
  videos of you perform, so that I can potentially collaborate with you in the future. 
* User Story 7: I am a visitor to your site, and I want to be able to find my way around your site easily,
  so that I can find the information that I need quickly. 

## Site Owner's Goal.

  I am the business owner, and want to have all of my promotional material in one place,
  so that it's easy for potential clients to access, and make a booking. I also want to make sure that our name is 
  clearly displayed, as well as our email address, and that there are links to our social media sites, so that 
  users can be directed to them in order to increase our following.

## Wireframes.

  I created some wireframes in response to the above User Stories. After creating the 1st site map, 
  I realised that the scope of the project was too big, and didn't really respond to the user Stories 
  in a conscise manner with good UX. So I then created 'Site Map 2', which is much better from a UX 
  point of view. My wireframes are [here]:

## Features.

  After reviewing my user stories, site owner's goal and wireframes, I decided to implement the following features throughout the site.

### Sitewide features.

* Feature 1: A clear, concise navbar at the top of the page. This allows the user to easily navigate the site and find the 
  information that they need. It is fixed to the top, in order to reduce the need for scrolling when navigating the site.
* Feature 2: A clickable email address in the top right-hand corner of the page, which links to the user's default 
  email client.
* Feature 3: A footer bar with links to our social media sites, so that users can easily visit us there too.
 
### Pages.  

I designed the individual pages based on my user stories, with good UX in mind.

#### Page 1: Landing Page.
    
* Feature 1: A strong, visually appealing hero image, in the form of a photo of the band playing on a stage at a wedding.
  This immediately allows user 1 to see what we do.
* Feature 2: A header with our name on it. This allows user 1 to immediately find out who we are. Also, as sometimes visitors 
  find us through generic internet searches, rather than by name, for the site owner, this will allow us to build brand awareness.
* Feature 3: A separate section with information on 'Who we are', 'What We Do', and our prices. This allows user 1 to quickly 
  find the imformation they need.
* Feature 4: A separate 'Quotes' section, defined visually by the use of a contrasting colour, for good UX. This will 
  allow user 2 to quickly find the information they need.

#### Page 2: Watch/Listen Page:

* Feature 1: An embedded YouTube video of Bombay Groove's Showreel. This allows users 3 and 6 to easily access the material they need.
* Feature 2: Embedded Sound Cloud audio tracks. This also allows user 3 to easily access the material he needs. 
* Feature 3: I have changed the background colour of the 'Listen' section to match that of the 'Quotes' section on the Landing Page, in order to provide
  continuity between the pages, and to create a clear separation between the 'Watch' and 'Listen' sections in order to maintain good UX.

#### Page 3: 

* Feature 1: Clickable headers, which each open PDF repertoire lists in a new window. One for each style of music we perform.
  This allows user 4 to easily find out whether thier favourite song is on the list, without navigating away from the page.  

#### Page 4:

* Feature 1: Photos of the band performing at events, and also some group shots at venues. This allows user 6 to see 
  what we look like, and visualise us performing at their events.

#### Page 5:

* Feature 1: Clearly displayed contact details (email address and phone number) with clickable phone and envelope icons.
  This allows all users to be able to contact us easily in order to make a booking or collaborate. 

### Features Left to Implement.

In future, I would like to add a contact form, that sends an email directly to the band's email address.
I would also like to add a searchable database of songs, so that potential clients can choose what they 
would like us to play more easily.
